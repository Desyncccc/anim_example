ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my ImGui Animation Project! ðŸŒŸ

This repository is dedicated to bringing smooth and engaging animations to the ImGui ecosystem. At the heart of this project lies an innovative approach to integrating animations within ImGui interfaces, aimed at enhancing user experience and interface dynamics.

Key Highlights:

- Custom Control Example: Included is a custom control that showcases the potential of these animations in action. This example serves not only as a proof of concept but also as a practical implementation that you can learn from and build upon.
- Ongoing Improvements: It's worth noting that the codebase, while functional, is currently in a stage of continuous refinement. Certain aspects, especially the animation class, are in a developmental phase, reflecting a balance between functionality and perfection.
- Straightforward Build Process: To build the project, simply set your environment to **x64 Release** mode. Thanks to the use of macros, there's no need for additional configuration adjustments â€“ it's ready to go right out of the box!

ðŸš§ Please Bear With Us:

As this project evolves, so will the cleanliness of the code and the sophistication of the animation functionalities. Contributions are greatly appreciated!
